        \section{\mysidestyle Work and Internships}
            \begin{description}
                \item[Facebook] (2013 December - 2014 February) \\
                    Internship working on the Facebook Android app as well as backend services required.

                \item[SnapBill] (2013 July - 2013 November and 2014 March - 2014 September) \\
                    Developer at SnapBill. My job functions include implementing custom solutions for clients,
                    ensuring high availability of the entire service, fixing any bugs that we are aware of in the
                    core product and implementing any new functionality. In addition to this I concurrently develop
                    the mobile app that interfaces with the core product's API.

                \item[MyNames] (2013 June, July) \\
                    Contracted to build an interface that provides co.za domain registration and management. 
                    Directly interfaces with Za Central Registries EPP Provisioning server. Written from scratch
                    to be elastically scaled on Amazon's AWS platform. Written in Python with Twisted.

                \item[2go Interactive] (2012 - 2013 December vacation) \\
                    2go is the biggest mobile social network in Nigeria. I worked on the Friendura app for Android. 
                    This was very challenging due to the massive scope. The biggest lesson I took away from 
                    2go was the importance of designing before starting on a project. I was burnt by this 
                    mistake and had this nailed into me constantly.

                \item[SnapBill] (2011 December vacation - mid 2012) \\
                    I started at SnapBill as a December vacation intern working on a number of SnapBill 
                    sub-systems. At the end of my internship I was offered a part-time position while studying 
                    cat UCT. Because SnapBill had such a small development team I had to learn the entire stack 
                    used by SnapBill. I learned how to use many interesting tools and products like node.js, 
                    Redis, Puppet and Continuous Integration systems. Besides learning interesting technologies 
                    I also had to consider the entire application lifecycle.
